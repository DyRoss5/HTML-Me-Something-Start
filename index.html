            <p>In May of 2023, I embarked on my first cruise to the West Carribbean islands leaving from Fort Lauderdale, FL. I was super excited about this trip because I got to visit Florida for the first time and I was about to spend 7 days on a ship visiting places that I have always wanted to visit. This week long trip consisted of stops in:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Bahamas</li>
               <li>Puerto Rico</li>
               <li>Turks & Caicos</li>
               <li>Dominican Republic</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The ship also came with many amenities that I was looking forward to enjoying during the time we were at sea. Including games, concerts, shows, contest, buffets, bars, and relaxation.</p>

            <h1>Bahamas</h1>
            <img src="/Images/bahamas-beach.jpg" alt="Bahamas beach courtesy of pixabay" width="750" height="350">
            <p>Our first stop was the Bahamas. It was a private beach owned by the cruise lines and there was no port so we had to board a smaller boat to get to the island. The water was beautiful and we were able to rent some clamshells in order to have a little shade from the sun. We didn't get to really explore the Bahamas as we didn't have access to the main land. We swam in the ocean a little bit and then we returned to the ship.</p>

            <h1>Puerto Rico</h1>
            <p id="testP"  class="funParagraph">Our next stop was San Juan, Puerto Rico. This was one of the stops I looked forward to the most because I've always wanted to visit Puerto Rico. We got to do a bus tour of San Juan and see different historic monuments in the city. We also got to go to this amazing seafood restaurants and get some of freshest seafood I've ever had in my life. It was definitely my favorite stop and I can't wait to go back.</p>

            <section>
            <h1>Turks & Caicos</h1>
            <p>Turks & Caicos had the prettiest water out of all of our stops. The water was so clear and the sand was white. Our port was another resort with swimming pools and a bar/restaurant. We were able to rent a cabanna by the pool with air conditioner when were ready to escape the heat.</p>

            <section>
            <h1>Dominican Republic</h1>
            <img src="/Images/dominican-republic.jpg" alt="Dominican Republic beach resort courtesy of pixabay" width="750" height="350">
            <p>Our final stop before returning to Fort Lauderdale was a resort in the Dominican Republic. We rented another cabanna while we were there and this time we also had our own hot tub that looked over the resort. We ordered food and we also had access to a small zipline that went over the larger pool.</p>
